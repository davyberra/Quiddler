# Quiddler Card Game

## Description

A card game for two players based on the popular game Quiddler. Players take turns drawing and discarding cards, trying
to make words from the letters in their hands. Each letter is worth a certain amount of points, and the hand size
increases by one each round. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins!

This was created using the Arcade module for Python, with the art/music created by myself.
